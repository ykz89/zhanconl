I received the middle plates for the Cocot46plus and assembled them. First the bottom side and then the top side. I choose to cut them in milky white acrylic.

The plates are cut from the same material and therefore the OLED cover is too, sadly the OLED is not visible anymore with this cover.

Adding these plates adds a bit weight, which is nice, and it also covers the open space between the switch and bottom plates.
