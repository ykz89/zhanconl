It was brought to my attention that by feeding 5V to the GPIO pins of the RP2040, with the method I showed in [the buildnotes  of Cocot46plus]({{< relref "2022-08-24-cocot46plus-build-notes/#33v-vs-5v" >}}), you may cause damage to the GPIO pin and/or reduce the life of the microcontroller.

The GPIO pins of the RP2040 work with 3.3V logic levels and are not tolerant for 5V. By feeding the ADNS-5050 sensor 5V and using it, it will send 5V to the RP2040. 

For a Corne for example, you are able to do this, because it doesn't have a sensor and are only outputting to the RGB leds and such. So no 5V input is sent back to the microcontroller.
